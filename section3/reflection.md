## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

* I felt good, not that I didn't struggle with some things. I found myself having problems finding the right search words for the problem in  `loops` on line 32 in my file where you needed to log the sum of 2 + 2, 7 times. I eventually stumbled on the solution after really studying the youtube video provided in loops and arrays. I also used MDN and JAVASCRIPT.info. I used trial and error to better understand what was happening. I also wrote out the problem like `2 + 2` seven times and thought about adding those all up in an attempt to visualize it. I think I got to the desired solution.
* The last question in loops-arrays was a big win for me. Another student, Carissa G., and I utilized the study hall to work on the problem together. We used both the provided videos, videos we searched for and docs to get to what we think is the right answer. She also helped me with the problem on line 113 of my arrays file. I asked her what her solution was because I thought I had solved it incorrectly. Sure enough I realized I miss read the problem and I was getting the answer I expected, but not the answer I was being asked for.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

* I have the weather app on my phone send me push notifications on weather conditions. The notifications are generally worded the same , then just have the type of weather inserted. I wouldn't be surprised if there was an array variable with the name of `weatherType` and values of different types of weather. Then using concatenation or interpolation, join together the `weatherType` along with the `string` saying "**Blank** weather will be starting in your area in **blank** minutes". For the minutes I imagine there is a variable thats value is tied to the time of day somehow using the internal clock or the internet.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

* An Array method is a variable that's name has a list of values. The values are wrapped in square brackets and separated by commas. The values can be strings, numbers, functions, objects and even other arrays. You can different data types in the same array. The values of the array are each assigned a position starting from zero. To call a value in an array you would use its position.   

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

* The purpose of a loop is to have a quick way to do something repeatedly. A loop can save you time because it will perform the given task over and over again so you don't have to manually do it.

* A loop will check a condition using a variable and numbers. Set what number the variable should start on, a condition where it should end and what increments to count by. The increments can be both positive and negative. The condition where the loop will end will evaluate to a boolean. The loop will run, counting as log as the boolean is returning true. When the boolean returns false the loop stops. The loop has a code block. Every time the loop returns true the code block will run. When the loop returns false the code block will not run and the loop stops.

* Loops can use the values in arrays by referencing the the position of each array value with the value of the loop variable. Code can be executed in the code block using the values of the array. Set the position of the array to be the value of the loop variable in order to run the condition of the loop through every array variable, or a portion of the array that is specified in the condition.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

* You have want to make a stack of blocks. The stack should be less-then 4. Every time the blocks are less-then 4 you eat a M&M. One block should be added at a time. You start by seeing if there are any blocks already stacked. There are 0 blocks, which is less then 4, so you eat an M&M. You take 1 block and add it to the stack because 1 more block is less then 4. Since 1 is less then 4 you eat a M&M. You take another block, and add it to the stack because this will total 2 blocks which is less then 4. Since 2 is less than 4 you eat a M&M. You take another block and add it to the stack because you know it will make a total of 3 blocks, which is still less then 4. Since 3 is less then 4 you eat an M&M. You count your blocks, at this point see you have 3 blocks, if you add another it will be 4 blocks which is not less then 4. You can not add any more block, and since you can not add another block you don't eat a M&M.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
* The solution I feel the least confident in is the condition that uses a collector to find the sum of 2 + 2, 7 times. I really stumbled on the solution I got, and want to understand that set up better. Otherwise, am interested in how loops and arrays interact with an application's other code. I want to know how they are referenced with the HTML, for example.
