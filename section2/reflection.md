## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* What resonated with me is
	I had never heard of “growth mindset” and “fixed” mindset before. It was exciting to hear Carmen talk about what it is because it was putting words onto something I have been trying to implement in my life for years. I know I’ll be able to better practice embracing the journey of trying new things when I can put words to the experience.

* The blog post helped me reflect on the challenges ahead in learning to code. I like the “SMART” goal setting method as a way to break up what otherwise would seem like a monstrous tasks. I haven’t read over the document linked in the blog yet on S.M.A.R.T, but I plan to.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* I currently demonstrate growth mindset with my approach to learning new things. Even when I don’t get something right away, or even after a long time, I am good at looking for new ways to approach the problem. I try to use coping skills to not get frustrated (breath work, maybe taking a break, some positive self talk). I trust that I will get whatever I am struggling with, I’m just missing the right puzzle piece. I am *not* practicing good growth mindset on things that I do understand, but am still making mistakes because I am new at them. I have a tendency to be a perfectionist, and it holds me back from producing. I spend to long fussing over things that really need to be good enough and let go.

* I have learned many hard things in my life that I pull confidence from completing. Most recently I taught myself how to use Blender to make 3D models and animations. The first time I opened Blender I was absolutely lost! I have used many digital art programs and can usually stumble my way through learning them without reference. Not one thing I recognized when I open Blender. So I got onto YouTube for tutorials and started reading the Blender docs. This was the first time I really made a point to read docs. There was a learning curve to that. It also took me something like 3 hours to get through one hour of video tutorial. It was a lot. I am no expert, but I can make the things I am interested in making now. Learning Blender gave me a lot of practice in teaching myself something. I learned new techniques in how to find resources because I don’t know anyone to ask questions about Blender. It feels really good to have confidence from learning something hard and I am going to carry that with me.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  I am happy to have the supports removed. I like to figure things out for myself. Having to go find the answer to something I don't know or can't remember cements them to memory better than if someone is directly telling me the answer. The most I struggled with it was with the logical operators. The docs given I thought made sense to me but when I went to implement the logical operators in the if statements I found I did not understand them well. It took me a while to realize I needed to see examples of if statements with logical operators used with variables and found some docs with them. I now understand them a lot better and believe I found a good solution to the problem I was solving.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

* A conditional statement runs through a set of `if` and `else if` conditions until it finds one that is true. JavaScript stops when it finds the true statement or reaches a `else` statement then used the code inside the statements code block for the the result.

* I think that the most "Popular this Month" blog posts on CSS-Tricks may be filtered by conditional statement that checks how many views or likes a blog post has and if it meets a certain condition then it's added to the "Popular this Month" highlight.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

A conditional statement runs through the conditions of `if`,  `else if`, and `else` until it evaluates a true condition or it ends up at the `else`. JavaScript will first run `if`. If it's true JavaScript will stop in it's code block. If it's false JavaScript will move onto the next conditional statement, `else if`. If that is true JavaScript will stop there. If its false JavaScript will  moving onto the next statement until it finds a true outcome. If JavaScript reaches the `else` without finding a true outcome, then the code in the `else` code block will be what JavaScript uses.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

If you want to check that two conditions are met you would use the AND `&&` operator. If you want to see if one of two conditions are met you would use the OR `||` operator.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I felt confident through this whole section until I got to the pizza problem in the "if-statement" exercises. I didn't understand how the logical operators worked when used with a variable that wasn't explicitly true or false. I found information on [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/logical-operators) that explained logical operators with examples using variables that helped me understand. I believe I found a good solution for the pizza problem, my conditional statement gets all the outcomes expected. I would like to know if there is a better way to write the statement or even other ways to write it.
